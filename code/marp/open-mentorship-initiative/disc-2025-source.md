# 🩵 We know that a good mentorship initiative...
- ... welcomes the perspective of newcomers, and recognizes that not everything may seem "obvious" from the start;
- ... transforms once restricted communal knowledge into something tangible, trackable, and shareable;
- ... creates, maintains, and promotes opportunities for growth — including a path to maintainership and leadership.

# We all have developed a deep understanding about open mentorships over the last two decades—mentees, mentors, coordinators, program managers.

---

# We need to find each other and talk to each other.

---

# We need to make sure this tradition will keep on going. Our knowledge should outlive us.

---

# We need to open source our knowledge.

---

# Goals for the weekend: Get to know our participants—
# 1. Have you been mentored?
# 2. Have you mentored someone?
# 3. Have you organized or facilitated mentorships?

---

# Goals for the weekend: Understand and reconcile–different points of view (mentee, mentor, coordinators, program managers).

---

# Goals for the weekend: Discuss—how do we define success and failure when it comes to open mentorships?

---

# Goals for this weekend: Come up with an idealized design—what would be the open mentorship program of our dreams?

---

# Goals for the weekend: Create an ontology for open mentorships—we'll create a model for our domain.

---

# Goals for the weekend: Gather as many relevant resources to be used as references for our Open Mentorship Handbook as we can.

---

# This weekend is a foundational weekend.

---

# Bring your experiences and your perspectives.

---

# You should tell us your stories, and it doesn't matter if they represent a negative, positive, or neutral experience with open mentorships.

---

# I'm your bridge. I'm here to listen and facilitate our conversations.
